# Installing Python

We are going to use the the Anaconda python distribution. Anaconda has a built in package manager and environment manager (conda) 
that you use with command line commands at the Anaconda Prompt for Windows, or in a terminal window for macOS or Linux.

## Installing on Windows

To install it is easy, double click the installer to launch. Follow the instructions. During the instalation it will be
shown a message to add Anaconda to the PATH. I recommend to select this option if this is the first python distribution
you are installing.
