# Installing Python

We are going to use the the Anaconda python distribution. Anaconda has a built in package manager and environment manager (conda) 
that you use with command line commands at the Anaconda Prompt for Windows, or in a terminal window for macOS or Linux.

## Installing on Windows

Download the last version from [Anaconda website]( https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#windows). Always use python 3+.
[python 2.7](https://pythonclock.org/) will not be maintained past 2020. 

To install it is easy, double click the installer to launch. Follow the instructions. During the instalation it will be
shown a message to add Anaconda to the PATH. I recommend to select this option if this is the first python distribution
you are installing. Unless you plan on installing and running multiple versions of
Python, accept the default and leave this box checked.
